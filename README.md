## Introduction
Dance teams across the United States, and across the world, make use of videos to learn and practice pieces. Videography is integral to dance, and has allowed for dancers to share their art with others through choreography and performance videos. Many dancers use videos to learn choreography from master classes or from practice videos.

Videography is also a vital tool when it comes to standardizing and cleaning a piece. Often times dancers will record themselves performing a segment or a piece and replay it to analyze their faults. Another common practice amongst dancers is to record oneself performing and compare it to a choreographer's performance to identify discrepancies or areas for improvement.

As it stands, however, there is no easy way for dancers to analyze or compare their videos online. Video hosting sites like YouTube allow for comments and annotation, but the comments are static (i.e. not tied to time markers), and annotations (which are tied to time markers) are clunky and often get in the way of the video. SoundCloud, however, has a commenting system where the comments are linked to a time marker in the music playing. The solution, then, was simple. Combine these two systems.

## The Product
VidFusion strives to serve **two** specific purposes:

1. Offer a time-based commenting system for targeted choreography analysis  
2. Facilitate side-by-side playing of videos for comparison of performance
